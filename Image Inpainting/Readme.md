# Adversarial Patches Dataset

This repository contains three sample datasets for the generation of adversarial patches. The datasets were sourced from Kaggle and IEEEdataport and can be used for research, experimentation, or educational purposes.

## Dataset Description

The following datasets are included in this repository:

1. **Dataset 1:** [Indian licence plate dataset for ANPR system with annotations in txt format](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravsanwal/indian-licence-plate)

2. **Dataset 2:** [Indian Number Plates Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dataclusterlabs/indian-number-plates-dataset)

3. **Dataset 3:** [Indian Number Plates Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dataclusterlabs/indian-number-plates-dataset)

4. **Dataset 4:** [Indian vehicle license plate dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saisirishan/indian-vehicle-dataset)

## Usage
